            <h3>Fair Use</h3>
            <p>
                Fair Use allows for the use of copyrighted works without permission from the copyright holder. Fair Use is determined on a case-by-case basis and considers four primary factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Purpose and Character of Use</li>
                <li>Nature of the Copyrighted Work</li>
                <li>
                    Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used in Relation to the Copyrighted Work as a Whole
                </li>
                <li>
                    Effect of the Use Upon the Potential Market for or Value of the Copyrighted Work
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Before submitting a copyright complaint, please consider whether or not the use in question could be considered fair use.
            </p>
