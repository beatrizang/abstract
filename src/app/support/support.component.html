                    Admins can manage and update billing information on behalf of their Organization directly from the <a href="#">web app</a>, including <a href="#">adding more contributor seats</a>, <a href="#">managing billing details</a>, and <a href="#">locating invoices</a>.

                For security purposes, Support can only assist with billing matters if you are an admin or can provide credit card information to verify your identity. If you want to use card information to verify your identity, you need to provide:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The name on the credit card on file</li>
                <li>The last four digits of the card number</li>
                <li>The card expiration date</li>
                <li>A screenshot of the last charge that Abstract made to the card</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you aren't an admin and can't provide the card information mentioned above, <a href="#">locate your admin</a> within the web or desktop application. Have this person contact Support with your questions.
